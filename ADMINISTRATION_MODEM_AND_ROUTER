ADMINISTRATION OF MODEM AND ROUTER
==================================

As most ISPs now integrate the modem and router this chapter will discutes them both together. It will also discust only the Telenet and Belgacom ones.

Belgacom
--------

The ISP Belgacom (also know as Proximus) delivers a b-box modem/router. This bbox is in the 3th generation now. They claim that it is more powerfull and more efficient but also easier to use. As I have only the b-box 2 I will focus on that model.
