COMPRESSION
===========

The need to compress files was born out of nesasity as the old connection to the internet only could carry so mush bits. Therefore a way as invented to make the files that were send over the connection smaller. There are several used compression algoritms but they all relay on the same priciple: "To use fewer bits than the original representation." There are two types of compression, a lossy and lossless and as the names might suggest the lossless doesn't remove any information and the lossy does. As the lossless is based on statisics and the lossy on the removal of information that cannot be perciefed by humans. Example: There is an image. The lossy will remove all the colors that cannot be viewed by a human so every wavelength that falls outside the 380nm and the 750nm. The lossless will analise the image bit per bit and look for repeating patterns. If there is a whole secuence of bits that present the color blue, eg. the sky, it will say somthing like: "from bit 100 to 1500, the color is blue". This will take less space then saying: "This bit is blue" a 1400 times.
